Based on the circuit described in the "RFID Access Control" project in
the book "Practical Arduino", this shield allows you to control a door
lock using an electric strike plate using a number of commonly
available RFID reader modules.

Supported reader modules include:

 * ID12
 * ID20
 * RDM630
 * RDM880
 * HF MultiTag

Features:

 * On-board 9V regulator to power Arduino from solenoid power supply.
 * Reset button wired through to Arduino reset pin.
 * Blue "Arduino power on" LED with current-limiting resistor.
 * 100nF bypass/smoothing capacitor on supply rails.
 * Overlay guide where you need it: both top and bottom.

Compatible with the Freetronics TwentyTen, Arduino Uno, Arduino
Duemilanove, and other compatible boards based on the same header
format.
